# Grace Material API

The Grace Material API makes available an HTTP web server with a REST API, serving materials to the [Grace](https://github.com/muzzarellimj/grace) client applications. This API is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and utilises the [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) web framework.

## Usage

### Practical

A user on the Grace client application uses the search bar to search for a game, "Super Smash Bros.", which does not yet exist in the Grace material database. As a search is made, results are displayed in a list with the cover image, title, and year published, and clicking one of these results will add it to the user's collection. The first option is clicked and the user receives a notification that the game is being added to their collection. Moments later, the user is rerouted to their collection overview page where the new game has been added successfully.

### Technical

After this repository has been cloned, the dependencies fetched, the .env properties added, and the web server started, an example request flow can begin with a search:

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8080/api/game/search?query=super%20smash%20bros'
```

... will garner response ...

```
[
	"status": 200,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": 1626,
			"name": "Super Smash Bros.",
			"first_release_date": 916876800,
			"cover": {
				"image_id": "co2tso"
			}
		},
		...
	]
]
```

Once a search has been made, a request can be made to either (a) store a new resource in the local database or (b) fetch an existing resource in the local database, all based on the source numeric identifier (e.g., IGDB ID):

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:8080/api/game?id=1626'
```

... will garner response ...

```
{
	"message": "Game stored with numeric identifier '1'.",
	"status": 201
}
```

Now that the resource exists in the local database, local fetch requests can be made:

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8080/api/game?id=1'
```

... will garner response ...

Players must defeat their opponents multiple times in a fighting frenzy of items and power-ups.

Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken.",
